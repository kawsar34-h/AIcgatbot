# AI Chatbot DApp

## Project Title
**Decentralized AI Chatbot Smart Contract** - A blockchain-powered conversational AI system

## Project Description
The AI Chatbot DApp is a revolutionary smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that combines artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. This contract creates an autonomous, learning-enabled chatbot that can process natural language, maintain conversation context, and continuously improve through user interactions. Unlike traditional centralized chatbots, this system operates entirely on-chain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralized ownership of AI interactions.

The smart contract implements three core AI functionalities:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzes user input to extract intent, keywords, and meaning
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and provides contextually relevant responses
- **Learning from Interactions**: Continuously improves responses based on user feedback and ratings

## Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize AI technology by creating the world's first truly decentralized artificial intelligence system. We aim to build an AI that belongs to the community, learns from collective human interaction, and operates transparently on the blockchain. This represents a paradigm shift from centralized AI monopolies to community-owned, open-source intelligence that serves everyone equitably.

**Core Principles:**
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the AI
- **Transparency**: All learning and responses are publicly auditable
- **Community Ownership**: Users collectively own and improve the AI
- **Privacy**: Interactions are pseudonymous and user-controlled
- **Accessibility**: Available to anyone with blockchain access

## Key Features

### ü§ñ **Core Smart Contract Functions**
1. **`startConversation()`** - Initialize new chat sessions
2. **`processMessage()`** - Handle user input with NLP and context awareness
3. **`rateResponse()`** - Enable community-driven learning through feedback
4. **`addKnowledge()`** - Expand AI capabilities (owner function)
5. **`getConversation()`** - Retrieve chat history and analytics
6. **`endConversation()`** - Properly close chat sessions

### üß† **AI Capabilities**
- **Intent Recognition**: Automatically categorizes user requests (support, pricing, transactions, questions)
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies important terms for contextual responses
- **Dynamic Learning**: Updates knowledge base based on user ratings (1-5 stars)
- **Context Scoring**: Maintains conversation flow and relevance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from successful interaction patterns

### üîí **Blockchain Features**
- **Immutable Chat History**: All conversations permanently stored on-chain
- **Transparent Learning**: Public knowledge base updates
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage and processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat or Truffle
- MetaMask wallet
- Test ETH for deployment

### Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-chatbot-dapp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contract
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Start conversation
const conversationId = await chatbot.startConversation();

// Send message
const response = await chatbot.processMessage(conversationId, "Hello, I need help with tokens");

// Rate the response
await chatbot.rateResponse(conversationId, 0, 5); // 5-star rating
```
